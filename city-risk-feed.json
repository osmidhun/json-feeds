Trains run between 05:00 to 22:00-23:00 Monday to Saturday, and 08:00 to 22:00 on Sundays and holidays. Note that carriages become very crowded during peak hours. Petty crime and occasional muggings take place in metro stations, particularly after dark.

Petty criminals often work in pairs and groups, including with children, where one assailant distracts the victim by asking a question, while another grabs the victim’s bag and runs off. Travellers should secure bags with a strap across the chest from the shoulder to the front of the opposite hip. Keep valuables such as mobile phones, jewellery and wallets out of sight. Do not use mobile phones near the doors on public transportation as theft can swiftly snatch and flee. Always leave your valuables in a locked hotel room safe, rather than carry them with you. Travellers should be especially vigilant regarding laptop bags, and avoid putting bags containing valuables on the ground.

Occurring predominately in Buenos Aires and its suburbs, express kidnappings - short-term abductions aimed at quickly extracting cash or other valuables from the victim - target people from all levels of society as well as foreign nationals and tourists. Victims often report having been assaulted, though fatalities are rare. Victims are commonly kidnapped outside banks or automated teller machines (ATMs) and forced to withdraw additional money while in the kidnappers' custody. They are often released within hours or on the same day after making one or even multiple payments. Criminals are also known to disguise themselves as police officers by wearing a full uniform or to pose as taxi drivers.\u003c/p\u003e  \u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eProtests and Demonstrations\u003c/strong\u003e: Protests and demonstrations are common in Buenos Aires and typically take place in the city's \u003cstrong\u003ePlaza de Mayo\u003c/strong\u003e and \u003cstrong\u003eCongreso areas \u003c/strong\u003eas well as\u003cstrong\u003e \u003c/strong\u003earound \u003cstrong\u003eObelisco\u003c/strong\u003e.

It is best to avoid large public protests by mapping alternate travel routes.\u003c/p\u003e  \u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSports-related Riots: \u003c/strong\u003eViolence associated with football has always been pronounced in Argentina. At least 305 people have been killed in football-related violence since the league began in the 1930s, and the problem has worsened - 137 of those deaths have occurred in the last 20 years. In recent seasons, matches have been postponed, the league suspended, and teams banned from their own grounds as a result of violence perpetrated by \u003cem\u003ebarra bravas\u003c/em\u003e (hooligans, or more literally fierce gangs). These gangs are said to be linked to club officials, politicians, and the police, and may be armed with knives and guns. As a general rule, visitors should avoid matches between major rivals, especially those between the Boca Juniors and River Plate clubs at '\u003cstrong\u003eLa Bombonera\u003c/strong\u003e'\u003cstrong\u003e stadium\u003c/strong\u003e (\u003cstrong\u003eEstadio Alberto J.

Since then, explosions in the capital have been blamed on anti-globalisation groups and have mainly targeted foreign banks. Anonymous telephonic bomb threats have also triggered investigations and evacuations at railway stations, banks and public buildings. In 2013, a homemade bomb detonated outside of a social security office after hours in Buenos Aires, causing no casualties. In 2012, three bomb attacks were recorded and targeted the European Union Offices, the Federal Department of Corrections, a theatre where former Colombian President Álvaro Uribe was to deliver a lecture and at a municipal office in Greater Buenos Aires.\u003c/p\u003e","health":"\u003cp\u003eMedical care and health facilities in Buenos Aires are of a generally high standard and are widely available. Well-trained personnel are readily available in hospitals, many of whom have studied abroad, and some health professionals have English speaking skills. Public hospitals provide emergency and non-emergency services without cost, regardless of nationality. However, the quality of non-emergency care in public hospitals is not comparable to that in private hospitals. Serious medical problems requiring hospitalisation in private facilities can be very expensive as doctors may expect upfront payment prior to the rendering of services. Buenos Aires has a reliable local ambulance service covering the city, although emergency response times may vary. They can be reached by dialling emergency number 911.\u003c/p\u003e  \u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eLocal Hospitals/Clinics\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e  \u003cp\u003e- Hospital Fernández (Public): Cervino 3356, Palermo, Capital Federal; Tel: 4808-2600\u003cbr\u003e - Hospital Alemán: Pueyrredon 1640, Recoleta, Capital Federal; Tel: 4827-7000\u003cbr\u003e - Sanatorio Trinidad: Cervino 4720, Palermo, Capital Federal; Tel: 4127-5500\u003cbr\u003e - British Hospital: Perdriel 74, Centro, Capital Federal; Tel: 4309-6400\u003c/p\u003e  \u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eVaccinations and Documentation\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e  \u003cp\u003eRecommended routine vaccinations include: Hepatitis A and B; Typhoid; Measles/Mumps/Rubella (MMR); Diphtheria/Pertussis/Tetanus (DPT); Influenza.\u003c/p\u003e  \u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eCommon Ailments\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e  \u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eDengue Fever: \u003c/strong\u003eDengue fever is a viral infection, transmitted by the bite of the Aedes mosquito.
